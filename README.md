# Unstructured_to_Structured_Data

Use Case: Structuring Multi-Channel Complaints

"LangExtract: The Next-Gen Approach to Text Extraction

LangExtract isn’t just another library; it’s a next-generation framework that redefines how we extract information from unstructured text with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Where traditional methods might fall short, LangExtract makes the process transparent, auditable, and repeatable. By being span-based, it links every extracted field back to its exact location in the original text, providing full traceability and enabling teams to catch errors faster.

In short, LangExtract can help you turn messy, multi-channel customer feedback into structured, reliable data you can trust for decision-making."
